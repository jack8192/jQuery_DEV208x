# jQuery_DEV208x
Lab3 of Introduction to jQuery, course DEV208x presented by Microsoft and edX.

You may copy this code onto your computer and customize it.  The customization
step is fairly simple:

1)  Modify page.html so that it retrieves jQuery from a location of your choosing.

Future Modification:
     A server side API will be added to this project that can run on your IIS server
to avoid using a URL that might become obsolete after the edX course closes.
